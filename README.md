# Aug 2020 Update - This is now a deprecated project

I was planning to do a rewrite round about now, but there are enough people working on the static sites problem in Svelte that I don't wish to contribute to the noise. Please check out these other projects.

- https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/
- https://github.com/junglejs/junglejs
- more on the way

I will be exploring moving swyx.io to one of these projects to support them.

## Why SSG?

Watch this 20 min talk: https://youtu.be/JEH0V-zNGUk

## What is this repo?

this is a monorepo for a Sapper Site Generator and related packages. Check README's inside `/packages` for more info on each. In particular:

- **[/packages/ssg](/packages/ssg/README.md) is the primary package**. Please click thru and read this to get started.
- [/packages/source-yaml](/packages/source-yaml/README.md) (status: active)
- [/packages/source-devto](/packages/source-devto/README.md) (status: active)
- [/packages/source-remark](/packages/source-remark/README.md) (status: inactive)

We also have an `examples` folder but its kinda inactive right now.

## Project Roadmap

I have been dragging my feet on SSG mostly because I wish someone else was working on it rather than me (it will never make money and I don't have time for it).

However the conversations I have daily at work always bother me and make me wish there was a better solution out there. Because nobody is working on exactly what I want, I'm forced to be the one to do it :( despite not having a better usecase for it than my own blog.

I am not at all optimistic this will ever be a wise venture so this is literally for shits n giggles until someone more serious than me picks this up. Because I'm not serious about it, it has an even higher chance of failure than the abysmal chance it had :(. at least i hope somebody else comes along and picks this up.

## Other attempts at a Svelte Site Generator

- Sapper
- https://github.com/jakedeichert/svelvet/issues/31
- https://github.com/PKlknr/svatic

## SSG v0

whatever i have now, the Sapper-based slow monstrosity. I can add:

- an incremental build api
- zero config filestructure based markdown
  - default ejectable theme
- preprocessed typescript and postcss
- DEBUG=*

## SSG v1

What I want SSG to launch with is:

- 0kb of JS for a page that doesnt use it
- visual editor? use netlifycms? fork sapper studio?
- incremental builds
- ludicrous speed. this probably means not using Sapper, and possibly using Rust/WASM.
- ejectable themes
- preprocessed typescript and postcss
- Zero config:
  - RSS
  - filestructure based markdown
- ship your own docs in CLI
- proper docsite
- `DEBUG=*`
- [Differential Dataflow](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/17/differential-dataflow/)

open questions:

- dev mode?
- no clientside routing?
- graphql?
- 404 search
- react import path?
- tailwind?
- graphql support?
- support 11ty's templating (mustache etc) and exact api?

## SSG v2

I actually wish i could work on this earlier, but Netlify doesn't support datastores now so there's no point:

- serverless serving if updates are found (so you get instant refresh)
- smart clientside routing? need to learn a lot more about this
- service worker layer?

TODO: check if there's a way to see if there's a new version of a page updated

- nested ssgconfigs so you can section up sites?

What else?
